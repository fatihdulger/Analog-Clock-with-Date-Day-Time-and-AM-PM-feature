# Analog-Clock-with-Date-Day-Time-and-AM-PM-feature
Built with CSS - HTML-JAVASCRIPT 
Having my desired features added to generic analog clock examples on the internet as my first ever project, I truly enjoyed building this small project that uses lots of CSS features and properties and requires good understanding of DATE topic in JS.
It may be far from being perfect, yet :)
